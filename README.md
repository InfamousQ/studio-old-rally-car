Old rally car in Bricklink's Stud.io 2.0 3D model format. Model contains TECHNIC frame with outer shell built out of SYSTEM parts. The frame also contains steerable front axle with suspension (inspired by [Hrafn Narfh's design](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100476839@N08/albums/72157644206213174)) and a powered and suspended live axle (inspired by [RM8's design](https://www.flickr.com/photos/86089499@N04/albums/72157687288924502)). Car's look and scaling is inspired by Ford Escort Mk1 Mexico model.

Model contains locations and required gearing for Power Functions servo and L motors but their wiring is not complete. There is plenty of space for further development still.
